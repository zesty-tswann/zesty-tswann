#### About 
Technical web applications development, not just brochureware websites but more complex integrations. 

Specialising in high demand critical systems on multi-server architectures. Architecting server infrastructure to provide high availability/scalability for real-time radio/audio streaming services. I co-designed and built the system that streams every English Premiership football match live around the world for talkSPORT Radio.

Using that previous experience I built a command and control application that integrated analogue audio feeds through hardware digital audio encoders and resilient infrastructure to enable the live broadcast of teh German Bundesliga commentary via the Amazon Music platform primarily on Alexa enabled devices.

Specialise in remote integrations, enabling legacy systems and modern systems to talk to each other through microservices and APIs.  
Writing APIs to allow third parties including mobile/tablet app developers to access client data.  

Setting standards for technical delivery in terms of quality control, systems control and development processes and practices.
